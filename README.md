# Ricardo Bank Server

Under construction.

Just a hacky implementation of the Open Banking APIs so a phone app can be tested against it.

To get it working you need a `resources` folder in `main` with an `application.properties` file and a `ec256-key-pair.pem` file.
These are not shared for obvious reasons.
